##Thought Essays Anchor CMS Theme <img src="img/logo-small.png" />

Based on my Bootstrap Thought Essays theme, I bring you the anchor cms theme of minimalism, maleability, and much more.


##What is it?

The Thought Essays Anchor CMS Theme is a simple theme utilizing Bootstrap 3.0 and custom styling to emphasize content, customization, and big beautiful images. You're welcome to look through the [test site](http://thoughtessays.com/) and the various ways different articles change the way the theme looks.

It's super easy to use, it's drop-in ready (no need to set anything up!) and it is continuously updated. You're welcome to do a `git clone` of the repository and do a `git pull` in order to get the updates! (if you're on a shared host and have SSH access, you're better off doing `git fetch` and `git merge origin/master`).

I left an `app.css` file for you to add your own styling!
